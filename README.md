# Topic-modelling-for-News-Articles
In the realm of information overload, news articles often cover a diverse range of topics, making it challenging to categorize and analyze them manually. Topic modeling serves as a powerful computational tool that automates this process, allowing for efficient and effective extraction of meaningful themes from a vast amount of textual content.


Steps:
1. Download the train.csv file from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gowrishankarp/newspaper-text-summarization-cnn-dailymail 
2. Run the PreprocessingFile.ipynb
3. Run the BERTOPIC_TM.ipynb using the preprocessed data from previous step
4. Run Streamlit app
5. Compare results with LDA TopicModelling.ipynb file

Topic modeling for news articles empowers researchers, journalists, and organizations to gain insights into the content landscape, identify emerging trends, and streamline the process of information retrieval and analysis in the ever-expanding digital news ecosystem.
